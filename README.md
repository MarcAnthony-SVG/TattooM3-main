# Tattoo M3

This project is intended to further my love of tattoos and my passion of coding. The goal of Tattoo M3 is to match find inspirations for tattoos based on user searches and predetermained sereaches based on trending styles. The idea came to me when my wife, who's a tattoo artist and enthusiested suggested I create a site deticated to tattoos.

## Difficulties
1. Learning GraphQL because prior to learning it I was unfamiliar with typed languages.
2. Authentication becasue it required a lot of time to dedicate to reasearch, however when time was made I find out it wasnt has difficult as I once thought.
3. The latest version of Node was having a negative effect on other packages and needed to be reverted to the previous version of Node 16.14.0
